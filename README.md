Tech Stack

How It Works
This project is a static front-end chat UI. It doesn't include any backend logic or API calls but simulates a basic chat interface where messages can be typed out and displayed. You can integrate this front-end with a back-end service in the future to handle actual conversations or use it for demonstrating UI concepts.

Customization
Modify the style.css file to personalize the look and feel (e.g., change colors, fonts, chat bubble styles).
Easily adjust the layout by modifying the Flexbox and Grid properties in style.css.
